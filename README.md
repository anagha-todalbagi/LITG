My mentee, Ina, completed the project successfully.

My mentee started learning python fundamentals through codeacademy and submitted assignments regularly. We progressed to Django from there and she built her blog from scratch using Django. We committed the code onto github regularly and hosted the completed blog project on pythonanywhere.com
